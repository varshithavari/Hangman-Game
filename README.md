The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. In this game, the player tries to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to "hanging" the stick figure. The game features:

* Word selection from a predefined list
* Hints to assist with guessing
* Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* Visual representation of hangman stages
* A fun and interactive way to practice Python programming concepts

This project is ideal for beginners looking to improve their skills in control flow, loops, functions, and string handling in Python
